# EdgeFunction/templates
Function templates for use with the Verizon Media Platform: Edge Function. These templates follow the spirit of the amazing [OpenFaas](https://github.com/openfaas/templates) project to provide a standardized way to define function runtimes for various languages. Huge thanks to Alex Ellis' work for inspiring the framework here!

In order to begin experimenting with EdgeFunctions on the Verizon Media Platform, please follow the handler spec for the desired language and provide a stack.yaml indicating the function to build (see #usage). Examples are provided for each language.

  You have created a new function which uses Node.js 12.13.0 and the OpenFaaS
  Classic Watchdog.

  npm i --save can be used to add third-party packages like request or cheerio
  You may add a private registry to the .npmrc file and use the NPM_TOKEN build-arg
  npm documentation: https://docs.npmjs.com/

  For high-throughput services, we recommend you use the node12 template which
  uses a different version of the OpenFaaS watchdog.
